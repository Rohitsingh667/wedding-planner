Q1 – Leveraging AI in Front-End Delivery
Ans. As a React developer, I have utilized GitHub Copilot as an auto-complete tool to provide boilerplate code for components such as product cards or forms. I'd no longer have to repeat typed boilerplate code with just the use of GitHub Copilot. For visual search features that I have implemented (like in my Scrapper project), I utilized AI design tools combined with existing CSS grids such as Figma's Auto Layout to quickly develop a responsive user interface prototype. For backend Node.js API's, Tabnine could also provide suggestions for secure authentication patterns, similar to how I created login systems within bookZone.

Q2 – Inventing an AI Feature for Class 11 Students
Ans.
Feature 1: AI Concept Clarifier\*  
We could develop an embedded chat interface. When a student hovers over a term that is slowing their learning of the concept the AI will explain it using a model analogy from the student’s textbook, or even a 3D model.

Feature 2: Adaptive Quiz Builder\*  
After a student completes their basic quiz/exercise, if they did not perform well, the AI will analyze the aspects that were incorrect and then generate multiple choice questions that are targeted to what they did wrong.
